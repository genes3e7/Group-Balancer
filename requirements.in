# Note on setuptools:
# pip-tools may mark setuptools as "unsafe" because it is a bootstrap dependency.
# If you need to pin it (e.g. for transitive dependencies), do so explicitly here
# or run pip-compile with --allow-unsafe to include it in requirements.txt.
# This prevents hash-pinning failures during compilation.
